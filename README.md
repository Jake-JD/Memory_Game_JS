Hi, just to give a quick summery this project is a memory game.

One of the buttons will flash purple and you will need to click the button in the correct order. For example, the red button will flash,
then the yellow button will flash on the second round. You will then need to click the red button then yellow in that order and so forth.

The score you get will display once you get the sequence of colours wrong.

Feel free to restart the game using the button at the bottom of the screen to play again.

If you want to cheat and see what is happening while you are playing the game, feel free to check the console(F12).
